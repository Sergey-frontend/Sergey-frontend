Hello! My name is Sergey, and I'm a student software developer. My goal is to create innovative solutions that bring value and enhance the user experience.

I have several educational projects that I would like to present:<br/>
**Brain Games:** This project includes five logic games related to numbers and calculations. It is designed to develop thinking, logic, and mathematical skills.<br/>
**Difference Calculator:** My Difference Calculator application is a utility for finding differences between JSON or YAML files. It also supports nested data structures. It is a reliable tool that aids in the analysis and comparison of information.<br/>
**RSS Aggregator (Website):** I have developed a web application that serves as an RSS news feed. It provides fast and convenient access to up-to-date news sources, gathering them in one place.<br/>
**Chat:** My chat application is built using React and Bootstrap. It is a simple version of a Slack chat, facilitating real-time messaging.<br/>

Please feel free to contact me for any inquiries or potential collaborations. You can reach me via:<br/>
**Email:** tolstikovsn@gmail.com<br/>
**Telegram:** @sergey-frontend<br/>
I look forward to connecting with you and discussing any opportunities to work together.<br/>
Thank you!
